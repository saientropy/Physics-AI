# Integrated Physics-Informed Inverse Design for Materials

This repository contains an initial implementation of an integrated framework that combines **Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs)** with **Deep Learningâ€“Driven Inverse Design** for material discovery. The goal is to create a system where a generative model proposes candidate material designs, and a PINN-based surrogate simulator rapidly evaluates these designs based on governing physical laws.

## Overview

- **Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs):**  
  These networks incorporate physical laws (e.g., partial differential equations) directly into the loss function to simulate physical phenomena (such as heat transfer or stress distribution) in a differentiable manner.

- **Inverse Design:**  
  A generative model (such as a Variational Autoencoder or GAN) learns the distribution of viable material microstructures and proposes new designs based on desired properties.  
  The proposed designs are evaluated by the PINN to ensure they meet physical constraints and performance criteria.

- **Integration:**  
  The PINN serves as a fast, differentiable evaluator within the inverse design loop, enabling gradient-based optimization to refine material designs and properties
